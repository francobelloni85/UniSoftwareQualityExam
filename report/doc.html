<h1>data analysis assignment</h1>

<p>The goal of the assignment is to carry out a complete data analysis based on a dataset.</p>

<p>Here are the steps to follow:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Selection of the dataset from the e-learning pages: ant-1.7.csv</li>
	<li>Selection of the dependent variable: software faultiness, i.e., the presence of at least one fault in a module</li>
	<li>Selection of the independent variables: select four variables in the dataset</li>
	<li>Visualization of the dataset via diagrams for single variables (e.g., histograms, pie charts) and diagrams for pairs of variables (e.g., scatterplots)</li>
	<li>Computation of descriptive statistics for the dependent and the independent variables</li>
	<li>Selection of one or more data analysis techniques</li>
	<li>Building of a set of univariate and multivariate statistically significant models
	<ol>
		<li>Make sure that their assumptions are satisfied, otherwise carry out outlier analysis and removal</li>
		<li>Whenever possible, use both parametric (e.g., Pearson&#39;s correlation coefficient) and nonparametric (e.g., Spearman&#39;s rho, Kendall&#39;s tau) techniques</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Description of the results obtained and the limitation to their use (e.g., threats to validity)</li>
</ol>

<p>For the assignment presentation, the students need to prepare a document and a presentation.</p>

<p>Both must be sent to the instructor by email at least 7 calendar days before the date of the session in which the assignment will be presented.</p>

<p>The document must illustrate the above steps.</p>

<p>The assignment presentation shall last no more than 15&rsquo; and will have the goal of summarizing all of the important aspects of the assignment.</p>

<br><br>

<p>La prima operazione da effetturare Ã¨ la scelta delle 4 variabili da analizzare sulle 24 presenti.</p>

<p>Sono state selezionate</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Weighted Methods per Class (WMC)</strong>  -> sum of the complexities of the methods of the class</li>
    <li><strong>Coupling Between Object classes (CBO)</strong> -> for a class, it is a count of the number of other classes to which it is coupled</li>
    <li><strong>Lack of COhesion in Methods (LCOM)</strong> -> given a class, it is the difference between the number of pairs of methods that do not share instance variables and  the number of pairs of methods that do share instance variables, if this difference is not negative. Otherwise, it is 0.</li>
    <li><strong>Lines of code (LOC)</strong>  -> is a software metric used to measure the size of a computer program by counting the number of lines in the text of the program's source code</li>
</ul>
